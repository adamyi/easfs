# EASFS (EAsy Static Front-end Server)

A web-server to allow fast development and iterations of static websites, based on YAML and Markdown.

It's similar to Jekyll but pages are rendered at request time.

While I did write all the back-end code (Golang), it currently uses the same front-end as Google DevSite,
because I'm lazy to write CSS. But it's a TODO to move this away from Google DevSite CSS & JS.

## Example
https://www.adamyi.com/ is served using EASFS and https://github.com/adamyi/adamyi.com
